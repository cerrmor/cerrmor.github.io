                                <p>Garrison Jabs is <strong>currently pursuing work</strong> within the tech sector. He received his <strong>Bachelor of Science with First Class Honors in Computer Science</strong> from the University
                                of London UK in 2023.
                                <br/>
                                Garrison's life experience and easy going attitude has made him a well rounded individual, who is liked by most who meet him.
                                His love of puzzles and inquisitive nature has driven him to consistently learn and expose himself to
                                new challenges and opportunities. This in turn has made him extremely resilient when faced with frustrations
                                and adversity. Garrison has also been known to have a large assortment of random facts up his sleeve and is
                                always down for a bad/good pun. Garrison can be found in his off hours spending time adventuring with his dog Charlie and partner Michelle.</p>

                                <h3>Garrison's Story of Learning</h3>

                                <p>After completing high school Garrison first dreamed of a career as a commercial diver.
                                This surprised many as he grew up in a land locked province of Canada with almost zero exposure to 
                                diving. After successfully following this dream to completion, his aspirations changed dramatically 
                                to the field of Engineering. This was dramatic because he had promised himself he was done with structured 
                                academic pursuit (specifically higher math). However, Garrison persevered and completed a Mechanical 
                                Engineering Technology program from the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology also known as SAIT. Being 
                                inspired by this early success he went on to pursue a professional designation in this field from Lakehead
                                University in Ontario. This did not end as successfully as the other dream. Not to be easily discouraged, 
                                Garrison did some soul searching and self reflection on the topics most enjoyed while studying. The topic 
                                of programming stood out the most. This was because he had achieved a grade of 100% which caused the 
                                instructor to feel the need to reach out. However, this was not to congratulate Garrison for achieving the
                                first 100 this instructor had ever given out, but rather to inform Garrison how he was not a perfect 
                                programmer, just a high achiever. Garrison only remembered the 100%. With this in mind Garrison found the
                                program offered by the University of London in the UK and began the adventure that led to this moment.</p>
