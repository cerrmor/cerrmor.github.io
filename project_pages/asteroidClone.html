								<h2>The Brief</h2>
								
								<p>The goal of this application was to explore the concept of applying physical properties such as, gravity and acceleration 
								to an animation. By implementing simple physics functions, and applying them to elements within the game, a basic physics 
								engine was created. This allowed objects within the game to respond more realistically. For example, the ship continues to 
								move in any direction once started. This is like the effect that a lack of friction in space causes. Applying these force 
								responses to actions, creates for a more enjoyable playing experience as it adds to the illusions built by the game. This 
								project was one part of four that served as the midterm submission for CM2030 Graphics Programming.</p>

								<h2>The experience</h2>
								
								<p>The user's goal in the Asteroids clone is to survive as long as possible. The user controls a ship and tries to destroy all the 
								falling asteroids before they hit the planet. Control of the ship's movement is done by pressing the directional arrow keys, and firing 
								the weapon systems by pressing spacebar. If the ship touches an asteroid or the planet surface, the game ends and must be restarted.</p>	

								<h2>Building Blocks</h2>
							
								<p>There were four main components developed which were essential for this game to function:
									<ol>
										<li>Collision detection</li>
										<li>Bullet management</li>
										<li>Asteroid management</li>
										<li>Ship management</li>
									</ol>

								The first component developed was the spaceship system class. This system was essential as it created the playable character for any
								user interacting with the application. The next system developed was the bullet system class. This system was necessary for the user 
								to be able to destroy approaching asteroids. The final core game element developed was the asteroid system class. This system controlled
								where asteroids would spawn and how fast they should move. The three systems together, produced a fantastic visual effect. However, an 
								additional component was required for this application to function as a game. Without collision detection, there was no way for the 
								application to determine when the game should end or when to destroy an asteroid. The following function was produced to solve this  
								issue of collision detection.
	

<pre>
	<code>
		//helper function checking if there's collision between object A and object B
		function isInside(locA, sizeA, locB, sizeB){
			if(dist(locA.x, locA.y, locB.x, locB.y) < ((sizeA/2)+(sizeB/2))) 
			{
				return true;
			}
			else 
			{
				return false;
			}
		}
	</code>
</pre>

								when ever the function returned true a collision had been detected. This information was then used, to call secondary functions which 
                                controlled responses within the systems. For instance, a bullet and asteroid disappearing upon impact, or the game ending when the ship
                                crashed into an asteroid or the planet.</p>

								<p>In addition to collisions, movement of asteroids and the players ship was fundamental to the game overall. For the player to have
								the sensation that the ship was realistically travelling in space, force vectors were applied in an additive fashion to the ship. This meant
								that the ship accelerated from zero to max speed and conversely decelerated at a steady pace. It also meant that the ship maintained speed 
								and direction as if the ship was truly exposed to the lack of friction in space.
	 
								
<pre>
	<code>
		//addativly applys the current force vectors to the ship
		move(){
			this.velocity.add(this.acceleration);
			this.location.add(this.velocity);
			this.acceleration.mult(0);
			this.velocity.limit(this.maxVelocity);
		}
		//called to apply the new acceleration added
		applyForce(f){
			this.acceleration.add(f);
		}
		//applys the acceleration vector in the direction pressed by the player
		interaction(){
			if (keyIsDown(LEFT_ARROW)){
			  this.applyForce(createVector(-0.1, 0));
			}
			if (keyIsDown(RIGHT_ARROW)){
			  this.applyForce(createVector(0.1, 0));
			}
			if (keyIsDown(UP_ARROW)){
			  this.applyForce(createVector(0, -0.1));
			}
			if (keyIsDown(DOWN_ARROW)){
			  this.applyForce(createVector(0, 0.1));
			}
		}
	</code>
</pre>

								The only exception to this was, if the ship enters the atmosphere of the planet it was protecting. The ship was then drawn to the 
                                planets surface and slowed down as gravity and friction were now a factor to contend with.


<pre>
	<code>
		//applys the planets gravity and friction to the ship
		setNearEarth(){
			this.gravity = createVector(0,0.05);
			this.acceleration.add(this.gravity);
		
			//applys friction as a subtractive force of the ships current velocity
			this.friction = this.velocity.copy();
			this.friction.mult(-1);
			this.friction.normalize();
			this.friction.mult(0.03);
			this.acceleration.add(this.friction);
			
		}
	</code>
</pre>
								
								Applying force vectors was not only reserved for the player's ship. Force vectors were also used on the asteroids to vary the speed at which 
                                the asteroids travelled towards the planet. Larger asteroids had greater gravitational pull and so travel faster.</p>
							
<pre>
	<code>
		//function that calculates effect of gravity on each asteroid and accelerates it
		calcGravity(centerOfMass)
		{
			//iterates the array of asteroids
			for (var i=0; i < this.locations.length; i++)
			{
				var gravity = p5.Vector.sub(centerOfMass, this.locations[i]);
				gravity.normalize();
				gravity.mult(.001);
				this.applyForce(gravity);
			}
		}
	</code>
</pre>	

								<p>The subtle additions that applied force vectors created, were far more compelling for generating motion, then other forms of motion generation.</p>

								<h2>User Interaction</h2>

								<p>The user interacts with the experience, by controlling the ships direction with the arrow keys, and firing its gun system 
								to destroy asteroids with the spacebar. This continues until an asteroid collides with the planet, or the player crashes.</p>

								
								<h2>Conclusion</h2>

								<p>This application was effective at showcasing the value of applying physical forces to game elements and animations. It made 
								for compelling game play by adding interesting challenges, despite the simplicity of the games rules. This project was the second of 
								four worked on as the midterm submission for the mandatory course Graphics Programming.</p>
