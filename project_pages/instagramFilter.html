								<h2>The Brief</h2>
								
								<p>The Instagram filter application, replicated an applied image visual effect similar to the one produced for Instagram 
								under the name early bird filter. This is why the application was named the way it was. This application was a continued 
								exploration into the field of digital image processing. This project built on knowledge gained from the previous foray 
								into the manipulation of image pixels, established by the average face project. However, as opposed to the average face 
								project, where the purpose was to create a new image from a set of images. This project was about using computer algorithms 
								to enhance an image with desirable effects. More specifically effects such as:	 
								
								<ul>
									<li>Inverting the images colors.</li>
									<li>Changing an image to grayscale.</li>
									<li>Applying focus to an image element by applying blur to surrounding elements.</li>
								</ul>
								
								Within the field of image processing, these effects listed are a very small subset of possible effects but, are a good 
                                starting point for learning about this subfield of digital signal processing.</p>

								<h2>The experience</h2>
								
								<p>When the user navigates to this application, they are greeted by two images and a set of instructions on how to use the 
								application.</p>
								
								<div class="box alt">
									<div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"></span></div>
										<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/instagramFil/experienceDisplay.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>
								</div>

								<p>The two images are the same image, with the exception that the image on the right has been processed through 
								a series of filters; the application gives the user the control to select which filters are applied to the final 
								image displayed.</p>								

								<h2>Building Blocks</h2>
							
								<p>The early bird filter was constructed by building several simpler filter algorithms. These filters were then stacked
								in series, where the output of one filter, fed the input of the next producing the following outcome.</p>
								
								<div class="box alt">
									<div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"></span></div>
										<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/instagramFil/earlyB.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>
								</div>

								<p>Many professional image processing filters are built in the same way to arrive at the expected outcome. The filters 
								that built the early bird filter were:
								
								<ul>
									<li>Sepia Filter</li>
									<li>Dark Corners Filter</li>
									<li>Radial Blur Filter</li>
									<li>Border Filter</li>
								</ul> 
								
								The first filter constructed was the "Sepia Filter". This algorithm took the original image as input and then processed 
                                that image pixel by pixel, applying a color transform to each color channel.</p>
<pre>
	<code>
		//color transform
		var newRed = (r * .393) + (g *.769) + (b * .189)
		var newGreen = (r * .349) + (g *.686) + (b * .168)
		var newBlue = (r * .272) + (g *.534) + (b * .131)
	</code>
</pre>

								<p>In many cases, there is a chance that this could produce a value outside the max value of 255. This would normally need 
								to be accounted for by clamping the value to the range of "0 - 255". However, the pixel array in p5.js is already a clamped 
								array and as such is an unnecessary step. This filter produced the following effect.</p>
								
								<div class="box alt bbox">
									<div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-uniform">
										<!-- <div class="col-4"><span class="image main"></span></div> -->
										<div class="col-2"><span class="image fit"></span></div>
										<div class="col-4 boxHighlight extraMargin">
											<span class="image fit">
												<img src="../images/instagramFil/husky.jpg" alt="" />
												<p>Original  Image --></p>
											</span>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 boxHighlight">
											<span class="image fit">
												<img src="../images/instagramFil/sepiea.jpg" alt="" />
												<p>Sepia Filter</p>
											</span>
										</div>
									</div>
								</div>

								<p>The next filter was the "Dark Corners Filter". This filter also known as vignetting, when combined with the previous 
								filter. Gave the impression that the image it was applied to was older than it truly was. To create this effect, the 
								luminosity/brightness of each pixel was scaled between 0 and 100%, at an extending distance from the center of the image.
								Pixels within a 300-pixel radius of the image center, were left at 100% luminosity. After this point and up to the 
								450-pixel range, the luminosity was scaled from 100% to 40% based on how far from the center it was. Finally, all pixels 
								past the maximum point of 450 pixels were scaled from 40% to 0% luminosity resulting in an image that fades from bright 
								to dark moving from the center. This can be seen in the following image:</p>
								
								<div class="box alt bbox">
									<div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-uniform">
										<!-- <div class="col-4"><span class="image main"></span></div> -->
										<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"></span></div>
										<div class="col-4 boxHighlight">
											<span class="image fit">
												<img src="../images/instagramFil/2filters.jpg" alt="" />
												<p>Sepia Filter + Dark Corners Filter</p>
											</span>
										</div>
									</div>
								</div>

								<p>The filter that came next was the "Radial Blur Filter". This filter was more dynamic than the other filters produced, 
								as the user could select where the filter was applied in the image. The effect of the filter produced, a subtle blurring 
								of the image that slowly increases the amount of blurring as it moved farther from the center of where the filter was applied.
								To achieve this effect, the image was passed to an algorithm that applied a convolution matrix to the images pixels and
								returned the new values.</p>

<pre>
	<code>
		//applies the convolution matrix to the image pixels
		function convolution(x, y, matrix, matrixSize, img)
		{
			var totalRed = 0;
			var totalGreen = 0;
			var totalBlue = 0;

			var offset = floor(matrixSize/2);

			for(var i = 0; i < matrixSize; i++)
			{
				for(var j = 0; j < matrixSize; j++)
				{
					var xLoc = x + i - offset
					var yLoc = y + j - offset

					var index = ((img.width * yLoc) + xLoc) * 4;

					index = constrain(index, 0, img.pixels.length - 1);

					totalRed += img.pixels[index + 0] * matrix[i][j];
					totalGreen += img.pixels[index + 1] * matrix[i][j];
					totalBlue += img.pixels[index + 2] * matrix[i][j];
					
				}
			}
			return [totalRed,totalGreen,totalBlue];
		}
	</code>
</pre>
								<p>However, this algorithm alone caused the whole image to be blurred at full effect. To produce a gradual blurring 
								effect, it was required to vary how much of the new value was applied to the image dynamically. Furthermore, to allow the user
								to select the origin point of the blur, this dynamic variable needed to be calculated from the point at which the user had clicked. 
								The dynamic value used, was calculated by initially calculating the distance from the mouses location, and the location of the 
								pixel to be updated. This value was then mapped to a value between 0 and 1 based off of the distance moving away from the point 
								of the initial click. This resulted in the following output:</p>

								<div class="box alt bbox">
									<div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-uniform" >
										<!-- <div class="col-4"><span class="image main"></span></div> -->
										<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"></span></div>
										<div class="col-4 boxHighlight">
											<span class="image fit">
												<img src="../images/instagramFil/3filters.jpg" alt="" />
												<p>Sepia Filter + Dark Corners Filter + Radial Blur</p>
											</span>
										</div>
									</div>
								</div>

								<p>The final filter was the "Border Filter". This filter mainly added the effect of making the image appear to be a polaroid.
								This was done by drawing two white hollow rectangles around the border of the image. While this is a very simple step in building 
								the overall effect, it was important because it brought the whole image together. As is clearly seen in the next image.</p>

								<h2>User Interaction</h2>

								<p>A user can interact with this application by pressing a series of keys on the keyboard. Each designated key invokes a 
								different filter algorithms to be applied to the second image.</p>

												<p>Early bird Filter</p>
											</span>
										</div>
									</div>
								</div>
								
								<p>Certain filters such as, the early bird and the radial blur filter also allow the user to click portions of the image 
								the user wants to be in focus with the mouse. The user is instructed on how to carry out these actions, by a instruction 
								menu at the bottom of the application as shown in the following image.</p>

								<div class="box alt">
									<div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"></span></div>
										<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/instagramFil/userMenu.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>
								</div>
								
								<h2>Conclusion</h2>

								<p>This application was extremely useful for illustrating the power of digital signal processing. It showcased how useful 
								information could be extracted from a digital source, and how that information could then be used for editing and improving 
								the output of the digital signal. This projected was the third of four mini projects which comprised the capstone submission 
								for CM2030 graphics programming</p>
