                                <p>This project centered around two main concepts. The concept of learning through interaction, and the
                                engagement of users with subject matter considered among the most difficult. Virtual reality (VR) was chosen 
                                as the delivery method, because it allowed desiging experiences that might otherwise not be possible. VR also
                                allowed users to come at the material from the perspective of play which has long been understood to increase 
                                learning and engagement. Fluid mechanics was chosen as the learning material, as it is considered among some of
                                the most difficult to understand and engage with. With this subject matter selected, real-time fluid simulations
                                were needed to make the experience respond to the users actions in a realistic way. These choice made were to
                                allow for a smaller learning curve with new users by making the environment behave within a users expectations.</p>

                                <p>The fluid mechanics VR learning experience teaches a user about fluid mechanics, by having them explore the information
                                through physical interaction. The user starts out in a museum like environment that introduces some history on the topic. 
                                For this simulation, it mainly focused on two historical individuals and their contributions. However, it could easily 
                                be expanded upon.</p>
                                
                                <div class="box alt">

                                        <div class="col-5"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/CSFinalProject/pythagoras.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>

                                </div>
                                
                                <p>Through exploring the room the user can find the needed info to unlock the teleportation orb that transitions
                                to the next scene. The puzzle that locks the transition serves two purposes, firstly to focus the user on what they need to learn,
                                and secondly to help transition the knowledge from short term memory to long-term memory. The next scene in the experience serves
                                as a hub connecting the user to the two labs that need to be explored and the end of the game. The user has a choice on which lab
                                to experience first, buoyancy or viscosity.</p>

                                <div class="box alt">
                                    <div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-uniform">
                                        <div class="col-1"><span class="image fit"></span></div>
                                        <div class="col-5"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/CSFinalProject/buoyancy.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>

                                </div>

                                <p>Once the user has selected a lab and transitioned to that scene, they are given clues 
                                as to what they are to learn, but they way the carry out the experiment is up to them. For example, the buoyancy lab, the user is
                                given two tanks of fluid identified by colour and the words dense and less dense, and a series of shapes of varying size. The user
                                is told that all shapes have the same mass.</p>

                                <div class="box alt">
                                    <div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-uniform">
                                        <div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"></span></div>
                                        <div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/CSFinalProject/buoyancyTools.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>

                                </div>

                                <p> The user can pick up the objects and freely move them about the room. When the user
                                places a shape in one of the liquids it responds based on its size and the properties of the fluid. for example the largest object
                                always floats, but the smallest of the same shape always sinks. </p>
                                
                                <div class="box alt">
                                    <div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-uniform">
                                        <div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"></span></div>

                                <p>There is also another quiz that locks the exit of the lab with
                                questions that can guide the user on what they need to do. By not being restricted in how to carry out the lab the user is free to
                                play with the tools given and discover they properties of the fluids themselves making the information more engaging and the
                                knowledge more likely to last. After completing the museum and two labs the user has enough knowledge to unlock the exit of the 
                                game and proceed to the credits.</p>

                                <h2>Building Blocks: Physics Engine</h2>
                            
                                <p>The largest technical challenge of this project was managing the computational cost of expensive processes.
                                While VR has come a long way in the last decade it is still a very computationally demanding task. This is 
                                fundamentally because of the high refresh rate required in rendering to avoid creating simulator sickness in
                                users of the experience. Adding to this cost, accurate fluid simulations are extremely costly as well. The 
                                complexity of force change and particle interaction calculations expands exponentially with every additional 
                                particle added to the simulation. Additionally most physics engines take advantage of the optimised computational
                                power of the computers graphic card to speed up calculations. However, this takes required compute cycles from 
                                graphics rendering, potentially slowing down the refresh rate of the experience.</p>
                                
                                <div class="box alt">
                                    <div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-uniform">
                                        <div class="col-2"><span class="image fit"></span></div>

                                <p>As real-time fluid simulations were fairly important for the accuracy of the user experience, a solution was 
                                required. Fortunately the unity asset store had a fast optimised physics engine that ran on the CPU called Obi Fluids. 
                                This allowed for the physics calculations to be solved in parallel to the graphics rendering without interfering
                                with animations.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Simulation layout</h2>

                                <p>The learning experience was built using: Unity game engine, C#, and Obi Fluids physics engine. With Unity’s active
                                community and visual editor, it was very easy to quickly prototype and test concepts to be implemented for the game. 
                                This allowed for more focus to be directed at designing the experience layout and resulted in a better play experience.
                                The simulation was divided between three main scenes to keep the user focused on the expected task, and to minimise the
                                resource cost of each part of the experience.</p>

                                <h2>User Interaction</h2>

                                <p>One of the most exciting things about VR is the feeling of being transported somewhere entirely new. This feeling
                                of presence is so powerful that users often inherently try to interact with the simulated world like they would with 
                                the real world. This makes object interaction a critical component for the plausibility of the experience. It also 
                                means that interaction techniques that closely resemble what someone would naturally do; for instance: reach out and 
                                grab a ball; are the easiest for a user to learn and replicate. This understanding directed the interaction techniques 
                                used within this simulation.</p> 
                                
                                <div class="box alt">
                                    <div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-uniform">
                                        <div class="col-2"><span class="image fit"></span></div>
                                        <div class="col-8"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/CSFinalProject/interaction2.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>

                                </div>

                                <p>However, being a simulation, it's not always obvious what object might be interacted with
                                because of this, it was also necessary to include visual hints such as an object highlighting when the users hand is
                                near it.</p>

                                <h2>Navigating the experience</h2>
                                
                                <p>The best way to navigate a VR experience often is to allow the user to physically move as they would in real life. This
                                is usually not possible as it cant be guaranteed that a user will have the correct space size to fit the generated world.
                                While this type of motion was included in this experience, it was expected that a user would primarily rely on 
                                teleportation to get around. This meant it was necessary to use visual elements such as colours, and a drawn line to show
                                the user where they would be travelling to and if they could.</p>
                                
                                <div class="box alt">
                                    <div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-uniform">
                                        <div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"></span></div>
                                        <div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/CSFinalProject/teleportation.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>

                                </div>

                                <p>To enable this functionality raytracing was implemented to 
                                calculate where the user wanted to travel to and to correctly draw a line. A secondary element of a teleportation area
                                was also implemented to indicate travel areas and register the hit of the raytrace.</p>
                                
                                <div class="box alt">
                                    <div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-uniform">
                                        <div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"></span></div>
                                        <div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/CSFinalProject/teleportationArea.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>

                                </div>

                                <p>In addition to navigating the current scene, users also needed to progress to the next scene in the experience. This was
                                done using a teleportation orb that displayed a simplified image of the next scene in its center. When a user picked it up
                                and brought it close to their avatar the screen begins to fade to indicate a transition was occurring. If the user let go
                                of the orb before the screen faded completely, they could avoid the transition. This was implemented using colliders that.
                                trigger the start and stop of a coroutine which does the hard labour of changing the level.</p>

                                <p>The overall experience proved to be very successful with users tested. The experience was designed to be played in about
                                15 minutes, but often users would continue to play long after they had solved the lab. More encouragingly though many of the
                                users exclaimed that they had learned something new through the process. Building this project was a lot of fun and I am very
                                proud of how it turned out. If you liked reading about this project or had any questions feel free to reach out send me a message.</p>
